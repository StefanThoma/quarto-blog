# A node to me.
This is a blog project covering some DS topics I worked on. 
The aim is to build a reference page to which I can refer back when I need to do something similar again. 
The structure of the project is based on [notes from a data witch](https://blog.djnavarro.net/) by Danielle Navarro, go check it out!
