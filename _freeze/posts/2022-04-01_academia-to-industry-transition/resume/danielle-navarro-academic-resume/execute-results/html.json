I held multiple Australian Research Council (ARC) Fellowships from 2007-2015 & from 2016 have been Associate Professor at UNSW Sydney. \n\n\n# Research Overview\n\nMy research interests lie within the field of computational cognitive science - I study the mathematical and computational basis for human intelligence, with a view to connecting this to animal and machine intelligence. With this in mind, my work covers a wide range of topics in psychology. I have made major contributions to understanding basic information processing (associative learning, similarity, reaction time), higher order cognition (categorisation, reasoning, decision making) and the social nature of human intelligence (iterated learning, language evolution, cultural evolution). My interests include topics in research methodology (statistics education, robust inference, model selection) where I have made substantial contributions.\n\nI have published extensively in the top journals in psychology, including 5 papers in *Psychological Review* -- the top theoretical journal in the field -- with numerous papers published in the top journals in cognitive and experimental psychology (e.g., *Journal of Experimental Psychology: General*, *Cognitive Psychology*, *Cognitive Science*; see [djnavarro.net/papers](https://djnavarro.net/papers/)), all Q1 Ranked according to Science Journal Reports (SJR). \n\nBibliometric summary: I have published over 150 peer reviewed journal articles, scholarly book chapters and conference proceedings papers. According to Google Scholar ([scholar.djnavarro.net](http://scholar.djnavarro.net)), my h-index is 35 and my work has been cited 470 times, with 751 citations in 2020. Recent papers I like include:\n\n  - Navarro (2019). Between the devil and the deep blue sea: Tensions between scientific judgement and statistical model selection. *Computational Brain & Behavior, 2*, 28-34 ([psyarxiv.com/39q8y](https://psyarxiv.com/39q8y/))\n  - De Deyne, Navarro, Perfors, Brysbaert & Storms (2019). The Small World of Words: English word association norms for over 12,000 cue words. *Behavior Research Methods, 51*, 987-1006 ([psyarxiv.com/mb93p](https://psyarxiv.com/mb93p/))\n  - Tauber, Navarro, Perfors & Steyvers (2017). Bayesian models of cognition revisited: Setting optimality aside and letting data drive psychological theory. *Psychological Review, 124*, 410-441 ([psyarxiv.com/25gcm](https://psyarxiv.com/25gcm/))\n\n\n# Teaching & Training\n\nMy university teaching has focused on teaching statistics and cognitive science at an undergraduate and postgraduate level; across my teaching career the median \"broad approval rating\" in my student evaluations is 97%. My teaching materials are available at [djnavarro.net/teaching](https://djnavarro.net/teaching), including the following university courses:\n\n- *Robust Tools*, a 4th year data science class in 9 two-hour workshops\n- *Minds & Machines*, a 4th year R programming & cognitive science class in 9 two-hour workshops\n- *R for Psychological Science*, a 3rd year R programming class in 6 two-hour workshops\n- *Perception & Cognition*, an 2nd year introduction to cognitive psychology in 6 one-hour lectures\n- *Cognitive Science*, a 3rd year introduction to cognitive modelling in 6 one-hour lectures\n- *Computational Cognitive Science*, a 3rd year computer science class in 27 one-hour lectures\n\nAlso listed are the following resources:\n\n- *Learning Statistics with R*, a free open access textbook that has been adapted for the JASP and jamovi software packages, with a translation to French (plus proposed translations to Japanese & Spanish)\n- *Data Visualisation*, materials for a half-day workshop teaching ggplot2 and gganimate\n- *Complex Human Data Summer School*, a 6-day summer school on modern research tools\n\nI currently supervise 2 postdoctoral researchers and 1 Ph.D. student. I previously have supervised 6 postdoctoral researchers, 11 PhD students and 21 honours/masters students. Most of my PhD students tend to go on take postdoctoral research positions (7/11), with 3 taking jobs in industry and1 undertaking further study. Postdoctoral researchers in my lab have taken academic posts (3/6), research fellowships (3/6) or jobs in industry (1/6).\n\n\n# Research Funding \n\nI have won 8 Australian Research Council grants (total value $3m) with continuous funding from 2004:\n\n- Hayes, Navarro & Kemp 2019-2021.
