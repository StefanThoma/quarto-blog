    "text": "As a data scientist or R programmer, you may be familiar with the benefits of version control systems like GitHub for tracking changes to your code base and collaborating with others. But did you know that you can also use GitHub to automate the testing, building, and deployment of your R projects? This process, known as continuous integration and deployment (CICD), can save you time and effort by ensuring that your code is always in a deploy-able state and by automatically delivering new updates to your users. In this blog post, we will show you how to set up CICD for your quarto documents on GitHub, including configuring a build pipeline and integrating a spelling checker. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a workflow in place that helps you catch spelling mistakes before they make it into your final documents."

    "text": "CICD\nCICD is often used in GitHub projects for package development where it helps to maintain a certain code-quality and style consistency across different contributors and developers. For R projects other than packages CICD is used much less frequently. I belief that setting up CICD pipelines for less complex projects with only very few contributors is still useful to ensure consistent style, spelling, and more.\nAs I am occasionally involved in creating teaching materials in R using quarto, I wanted to implement some CICD checks for quarto documents. As most out-of-the-box CICD pipelines are designed for package development, existing pipelines needed some adjustment to work with other R projects."

The development of materials happens on the devel branch with a pending merge request to the main branch. Whenever a chapter or a section is ready to be published, I merge the branches. I wanted to create a pipeline that runs a spell-check on all my quarto files on the merge request with main, i.e.: Whenever I push to devel I want GitHub to run the CICD pipeline to check my spelling. As an example, I will show how to implement spelling CICD on this blog-project."

    "text": "Spell-check\nBecause R is all I know, I would like to use an R-package to do the spell-checking. The spelling package is well suited for the task, as it allows to spell-check all files at once. Before we try to implement the CICD pipeline, the spell-checker has to work locally, so we first install and load the package:\n\ninstall.packages(spelling)\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.0 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\nlibrary(spelling)\n\nIf you are working on a package, you can directly use the function spell_check_package() and the spelling package will do so. If you are working on any other R project you have to use the spell_check_files() function and you have to include a path to the files you want to check. Let’s check just this file:\n\n#2023-01-09_CICD-spelling/\nspelling::spell_check_files(path = \"index.qmd\")\n\n  WORD         FOUND IN\ncallout      index.qmd:109\nCICD         index.qmd:2,6,8,9,16,27,28,31,33,34,35,37,38,46,47,53,70,74,117,128,149,150,151,153,237,279\ndesc         index.qmd:231,265\ndjnavarro    index.qmd:211\nenglish      index.qmd:273,275\neval         index.qmd:56,131,156,182,240\ngerman       index.qmd:273\ngithub       index.qmd:150\nhttps        index.qmd:211\nhunspell     index.qmd:274\nìnst        index.qmd:224\nlockfile     index.qmd:17\npng          index.qmd:9\nqmd          index.qmd:71,84,96,106,112,113,124,141,173,204,233,257\nqmd's        index.qmd:103\nreadr        index.qmd:173,204,233,257,268\nrenv         index.qmd:17\nrepo         index.qmd:165,196,216,249\nRproj        index.qmd:112\nRscript      index.qmd:170,174,201,205,220,254,258,262\nsubfolders   index.qmd:105\ntestthat     index.qmd:231,232,260,261,265,266\nThoma        index.qmd:4\ntidyverse    index.qmd:61,163,194,212,247\nubuntu       index.qmd:162,193,246\nwordlist     index.qmd:79,84,90,97,121,132\nWORDLIST     index.qmd:128,132,135,142,173,204,224,233,257,268\nyaml         index.qmd:153,155,181,190,239\n\n\nIt looks like there are a few words that spelling did not recognize, mostly file extensions, my last name, and the word CICD (which apparently I overuse). We should carefully look through this list and decide, whether any mistakes were made. We would not want the GitHub action to prohibit a merge request for any of these words, as there are no typos present (I hope). Therefore, we want to add these words to a file that include words to be ignored by the spelling package.\nIf you are working on a package, this is easy, you can use the spelling::update_wordlist() function. We simply save the list of words as a .txt file. For now, we save it in the working directory.\n\nwrite(spelling::spell_check_files(path = \"index.qmd\")[[1]], \"wordlist.txt\")\n\nThe file looks like this:\n\nread_lines(\"wordlist.txt\")\n\n [1] \"callout\"    \"CICD\"       \"desc\"       \"djnavarro\"  \"english\"   \n [6] \"eval\"       \"german\"     \"github\"     \"https\"      \"hunspell\"  \n[11] \"ìnst\"       \"lockfile\"   \"png\"        \"qmd\"        \"qmd's\"     \n[16] \"readr\"      \"renv\"       \"repo\"       \"Rproj\"      \"Rscript\"   \n[21] \"subfolders\" \"testthat\"   \"Thoma\"      \"tidyverse\"  \"ubuntu\"    \n[26] \"wordlist\"   \"WORDLIST\"   \"yaml\"      \n\n\nNow we can tell spelling to ignore the words in this file from typo-detection:\n\nspelling::spell_check_files(path = \"index.qmd\", \n                            ignore = read_lines(\"wordlist.txt\"))\n\nNo spelling errors found.\n\n\n\nlink to the package description spelling\n\n\n# we can get all qmd's in a project by \nlist.files(path = \"../..\", # first setting the path to the project\n           recursive = TRUE, # include subfolders\n           pattern = \".*.qmd$\") # include only files ending in .qmd\n\n[1] \"index.qmd\"                               \n[2] \"posts/2023-01-09_CICD-spelling/index.qmd\"\n[3] \"posts/2023-01-09_welcome/index.qmd\"      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npath\n\n\n\nThe structure of this project is such that each blog-post .qmd file is two folders down from the .Rproj file. The working directory of the .qmd blog-post file is where the file is located. If I want to list files or save files in a higher order folder I need to adjust my path to first go two folders up. I do this by adding \"../..\" to my file paths.\nThe working directory of the CICD pipeline is by default on project level, therefore, the \"../..\" is not required.\n\n\n\nwordlist <- list.files(path = \"../..\", \n                       recursive = TRUE, \n                       full.names = TRUE,\n                       pattern = \".*.qmd$\") %>% \n  spelling::spell_check_files()\n\nThis can now be saved into a project level WORDLIST file to be accessed later by our CICD workflow.\n\nwrite(x = wordlist[[1]], file =   \"../../inst/WORDLIST.txt\")\n\nCheck again with WORDLIST:\n\nlist.files(path = \"../..\", \n                       recursive = TRUE, \n                       full.names = TRUE,\n                       pattern = \".*.qmd$\") %>% \n  spelling::spell_check_files(ignore = read_lines(\"../../inst/WORDLIST.txt\"))\n\n  WORD       FOUND IN\ncallout    index.qmd:109\nenglish    index.qmd:273,275\ngerman     index.qmd:273\nhunspell   index.qmd:274\nRproj      index.qmd:112\n\n\nLooks like it worked — great!"

    "text": "Setup\nNow this needs to be implemented in the CICD pipeline. To implement GitHub CICD I create a folder .github in the project directory, and the folder workflows within the .github folder. This is where CICD pipelines are stored.\nCICD pipelines written in yaml format, it should look like this:\n#| eval: false\nname: Spellcheck\non:\n  pull_request: {branches: ['main']}\njobs:\n  Spelling:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    container: {image: \"rocker/tidyverse:4.2.1\"}\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Install spelling\n        run: if (!require(\"spelling\")) install.packages(\"spelling\")\n        shell: Rscript {0}\n\n      - name: Run Spelling Check test\n        run: spelling::spell_check_files(list.files(pattern = \".*.qmd$\", recursive = TRUE), ignore = readr::read_lines(\"inst/WORDLIST.txt\"))\n        shell: Rscript {0}\nThe first few lines define the name of the workflow (Spellcheck) and when it should be executed.\n\nIn this case, the action runs on pull requests to the main branch.\n#| eval: false\nname: Spellcheck\non:\n  pull_request: {branches: ['main']}\nThen, we define the job to run:\njobs:\n  Spelling:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    container: {image: \"rocker/tidyverse:4.2.1\"}\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Install spelling\n        run: if (!require(\"spelling\")) install.packages(\"spelling\")\n        shell: Rscript {0}\n\n      - name: Run Spelling Check test\n        run: spelling::spell_check_files(list.files(pattern = \".*.qmd$\", recursive = TRUE), ignore = readr::read_lines(\"inst/WORDLIST.txt\"))\n        shell: Rscript {0}\n        \nWe run just one job called Spelling.\nIt is run on a docker image deployed by GitHub. We use a particular docker image that comes with R and tidyverse preinstalled, this eases the use of R in this image.\nThe actual workflow is defined in the steps (which can be named) — here we only have three steps.\n\nactions/checkout@v3 loads the GitHub repository so the subsequent steps can reference the repo.\nNext, the Install spelling step installs the R package spelling. This is written in R code, so we need to specify that we run the command in R. We do this with the instruction shell: Rscript {0}.\nAt last, we run the spell check in R. By default, the code is executed in the project level directory, so we do not need to adjust the path in the list.files() function to go up the project directory. The same goes for the ìnst/WORDLIST file.\n\nNow while this works, it will not throw an error if typos are spotted. We can remedy this by writing code that throws an error if there is a typo:\n\ntestthat::test_that(desc = \"No Typo\", \n                    code = testthat::expect_equal(\n                      object = spelling::spell_check_files(path = list.files(path = \"../..\", pattern = \".*.qmd$\", recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE), ignore = readr::read_lines(\"../../inst/WORDLIST.txt\")),\n                      expected = spelling::spell_check_files(list.files(path = \"../../inst\"), ignore = read_lines(list.files(path = \"../../inst\")))))\n\n── Failure (???): No Typo ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nspelling::spell_check_files(...) not equal to spelling::spell_check_files(...).\nAttributes: < Component \"row.names\": Numeric: lengths (5, 0) differ >\nComponent \"word\": Lengths (5, 0) differ (string compare on first 0)\nComponent \"found\": Length mismatch: comparison on first 0 components\n\n\nError in `reporter$stop_if_needed()`:\n! Test failed\n\n\nWe can now implement this test into our CICD workflow:\n#| eval: false\nname: Spellcheck\non:\n  pull_request: {branches: ['main']}\njobs:\n  Spelling:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    container: {image: \"rocker/tidyverse:4.2.1\"}\n    steps:\n      - name: 1 Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: 2 Install spelling\n        run: if (!require(\"spelling\")) install.packages(\"spelling\")\n        shell: Rscript {0}\n\n      - name: 3 Run Spelling Check test\n        run: (check <- spelling::spell_check_files(list.files(pattern = \".*.qmd$\", recursive = TRUE), ignore = readr::read_lines(\"inst/WORDLIST.txt\")))\n        shell: Rscript {0}\n        \n      - name: 4 Install testthat\n        run: if (!require(\"testthat\")) install.packages(\"testthat\")\n        shell: Rscript {0}\n        \n      - name: 5 Test spellcheck\n        run: testthat::test_that(desc = \"No Typo\", \n                    code = testthat::expect_equal(\n                      object = check, # as it was saved in step 3\n                      expected = spelling::spell_check_files(path = \"inst/WORDLIST.txt\", ignore = readr::read_lines(\"inst/WORDLIST.txt\"))))"
