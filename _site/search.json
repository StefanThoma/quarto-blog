    "text": "As a data scientist or R programmer, you may be familiar with the benefits of version control systems like GitHub for tracking changes to your code base and collaborating with others. But did you know that you can also use GitHub to automate the testing, building, and deployment of your R projects? This process, known as continuous integration and deployment (CICD), can save you time and effort by ensuring that your code is always in a deploy-able state and by automatically delivering new updates to your users. In this blog post, we will show you how to set up CICD for your quarto documents on GitHub, including configuring a build pipeline and integrating a spelling checker. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a workflow in place that helps you catch spelling mistakes before they make it into your final documents."

For R projects other than packages CICD is used much less frequently. I belief that setting up CICD pipelines for less complex projects with only very few contributors is still useful to ensure consistent style, spelling, and more.\nAs I am occasionally involved in creating teaching materials in R using quarto, I wanted to implement some CICD checks for quarto documents. As most out-of-the-box CICD pipelines are designed for package development, existing pipelines needed some adjustment to work with other R projects."

The development of materials happens on the devel branch with a pending merge request to the main branch. Whenever a chapter or a section is ready to be published, I merge the branches. I wanted to create a pipeline that runs a spell-check on all my quarto files on the merge request with main, i.e.: Whenever I push to devel I want GitHub to run the CICD pipeline to check my spelling. As an example, I will show how to implement spelling CICD on this blog-project."

    "text": "Spell-check\nBecause R is all I know, I would like to use an R-package to do the spell-checking. The spelling package is well suited for the task, as it allows to spell-check all files at once. Before we try to implement the CICD pipeline, the spell-checker has to work locally, so we first install and load the package:\n\ninstall.packages(spelling)\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.0 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\nlibrary(spelling)\n\nIf you are working on a package, you can directly use the function spell_check_package() and the spelling package will do so. If you are working on any other R project you have to use the spell_check_files() function and you have to include a path to the files you want to check. Let’s check just this file:\n\n#2023-01-09_CICD-spelling/\nspelling::spell_check_files(path = \"index.qmd\")\n\n  WORD             FOUND IN\naff              index.qmd:311,312,313\ncallout          index.qmd:109\nCICD             index.qmd:2,6,8,9,16,27,28,31,33,34,35,37,38,46,47,53,70,74,117,128,149,150,151,153,244,285\nde               index.qmd:312,313,320\ndesc             index.qmd:231,271\ndic              index.qmd:311,312,313\ndjnavarro        index.qmd:211\ndoch             index.qmd:291,292\neval             index.qmd:56,131,156,182\nframi            index.qmd:312,313,320\nFRAMI            index.qmd:313\ngithub           index.qmd:150,308\nhört            index.qmd:291,292\nhttps            index.qmd:211,308\nhunspell         index.qmd:280,301,304,311,313\nìnst            index.qmd:224\njeder            index.qmd:291,292\nJW               index.qmd:287\nlang             index.qmd:313,320\nlockfile         index.qmd:17\nnur              index.qmd:291,292\npng              index.qmd:9\npre              index.qmd:281\nqmd              index.qmd:71,84,96,106,112,113,124,141,173,204,233,263,271\nqmd's            index.qmd:103\nreadr            index.qmd:173,204,235,238,263,271\nrenv             index.qmd:17\nrepo             index.qmd:165,196,216,255,308,309\nRproj            index.qmd:112\nRscript          index.qmd:170,174,201,205,220,260,264,268,272\nRStudio          index.qmd:322\nsubfolders       index.qmd:105\ntestthat         index.qmd:231,232,266,267,271\nThoma            index.qmd:4\ntidyverse        index.qmd:61,163,194,212,253\nubuntu           index.qmd:162,193,252\nverowokjnsthet   index.qmd:291,292\nvon              index.qmd:287\nwordlist         index.qmd:79,84,90,97,121,132,275\nWORDLIST         index.qmd:128,132,135,142,173,204,224,235,237,238,263,271,312\nyaml             index.qmd:153,155,181,190,246\nzitat            index.qmd:290\nZitat            index.qmd:290,291,292,298,320\n\n\nIt looks like there are a few words that spelling did not recognize, mostly file extensions, my last name, and the word CICD (which apparently I overuse). We should carefully look through this list and decide, whether any mistakes were made. We would not want the GitHub action to prohibit a merge request for any of these words, as there are no typos present (I hope). Therefore, we want to add these words to a file that include words to be ignored by the spelling package.\nIf you are working on a package, this is easy, you can use the spelling::update_wordlist() function. We simply save the list of words as a .txt file. For now, we save it in the working directory.\n\nwrite(spelling::spell_check_files(path = \"index.qmd\")[[1]], \"wordlist.txt\")\n\nThe file looks like this:\n\nread_lines(\"wordlist.txt\")\n\n [1] \"aff\"            \"callout\"        \"CICD\"           \"de\"            \n [5] \"desc\"           \"dic\"            \"djnavarro\"      \"doch\"          \n [9] \"eval\"           \"frami\"          \"FRAMI\"          \"github\"        \n[13] \"hört\"           \"https\"          \"hunspell\"       \"ìnst\"          \n[17] \"jeder\"          \"JW\"             \"lang\"           \"lockfile\"      \n[21] \"nur\"            \"png\"            \"pre\"            \"qmd\"           \n[25] \"qmd's\"          \"readr\"          \"renv\"           \"repo\"          \n[29] \"Rproj\"          \"Rscript\"        \"RStudio\"        \"subfolders\"    \n[33] \"testthat\"       \"Thoma\"          \"tidyverse\"      \"ubuntu\"        \n[37] \"verowokjnsthet\" \"von\"            \"wordlist\"       \"WORDLIST\"      \n[41] \"yaml\"           \"zitat\"          \"Zitat\"         \n\n\nNow we can tell spelling to ignore the words in this file from typo-detection:\n\nspelling::spell_check_files(path = \"index.qmd\", \n                            ignore = read_lines(\"wordlist.txt\"))\n\nNo spelling errors found.\n\n\n\nlink to the package description spelling\n\n\n# we can get all qmd's in a project by \nlist.files(path = \"../..\", # first setting the path to the project\n           recursive = TRUE, # include subfolders\n           pattern = \".*.qmd$\") # include only files ending in .qmd\n\n[1] \"index.qmd\"                               \n[2] \"posts/2023-01-09_CICD-spelling/index.qmd\"\n[3] \"posts/2023-01-09_welcome/index.qmd\"      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npath\n\n\n\nThe structure of this project is such that each blog-post .qmd file is two folders down from the .Rproj file.

To implement GitHub CICD I create a folder .github in the project directory, and the folder workflows within the .github folder. This is where CICD pipelines are stored.\nCICD pipelines written in yaml format, it should look like this:\n#| eval: false\nname: Spellcheck\non:\n  pull_request: {branches: ['main']}\njobs:\n  Spelling:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    container: {image: \"rocker/tidyverse:4.2.1\"}\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Install spelling\n        run: if (!require(\"spelling\")) install.packages(\"spelling\")\n        shell: Rscript {0}\n\n      - name: Run Spelling Check test\n        run: spelling::spell_check_files(list.files(pattern = \".*.qmd$\", recursive = TRUE), ignore = readr::read_lines(\"inst/WORDLIST_EXAMPLE.txt\"))\n        shell: Rscript {0}\nThe first few lines define the name of the workflow (Spellcheck) and when it should be executed.\n\nIn this case, the action runs on pull requests to the main branch.\n#| eval: false\nname: Spellcheck\non:\n  pull_request: {branches: ['main']}\nThen, we define the job to run:\njobs:\n  Spelling:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    container: {image: \"rocker/tidyverse:4.2.1\"}\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Install spelling\n        run: if (!require(\"spelling\")) install.packages(\"spelling\")\n        shell: Rscript {0}\n\n      - name: Run Spelling Check test\n        run: spelling::spell_check_files(list.files(pattern = \".*.qmd$\", recursive = TRUE), ignore = readr::read_lines(\"inst/WORDLIST_EXAMPLE.txt\"))\n        shell: Rscript {0}\n        \nWe run just one job called Spelling.\nIt is run on a docker image deployed by GitHub. We use a particular docker image that comes with R and tidyverse preinstalled, this eases the use of R in this image.\nThe actual workflow is defined in the steps (which can be named) — here we only have three steps.\n\nactions/checkout@v3 loads the GitHub repository so the subsequent steps can reference the repo.\nNext, the Install spelling step installs the R package spelling. This is written in R code, so we need to specify that we run the command in R. We do this with the instruction shell: Rscript {0}.\nAt last, we run the spell check in R. By default, the code is executed in the project level directory, so we do not need to adjust the path in the list.files() function to go up the project directory. The same goes for the ìnst/WORDLIST_EXAMPLE file.\n\nNow while this works, it will not throw an error if typos are spotted.

This package comes with the English dictionary pre-installed. Further, it looks at the user library for any other dictionaries requested in the spelling function call.\nWe can add dictionaries to the user library in the OS we are using to locally check the spelling in our projects. As soon as we want to spell-check on GitHub (with CICD) it gets a bit more tricky because we need to reference a library file within the CICD workflow.\nLet’s write a file that contains a German quote (by JW von Goethe).\n\n#zitat <- file(\"Zitat.txt\", encoding = \"UTF-8\")\n#write(x = \"Es hört doch jeder nur, was er verowokjnsthet.\", file = \"Zitat.txt\")\nwrite_lines(\"Es hört doch jeder nur, was er verowokjnsthet.\", file = \"Zitat.txt\")\n\nThe spelling package does not recognize the language in a file:\n\nspelling::spell_check_files(\"Zitat.txt\")\n\n  WORD             FOUND IN\ndoch             Zitat.txt:1\nhört            Zitat.txt:1\njeder            Zitat.txt:1\nnur              Zitat.txt:1\nverowokjnsthet   Zitat.txt:1\n\n\nWe can list the dictionaries that are currently available to the hunspell package.\n\nhunspell::list_dictionaries()\n\n[1] \"de_CH_frami\" \"en_AU\"       \"en_CA\"       \"en_GB\"       \"en_US\"      \n\n\nApparently, only English dictionaries are available at the moment. You can download dictionaries from the LibreOffice GitHub repo. For me, the easiest way was to download the entire repo as a .zip folder and then move the dictionary files manually into the repo in which you want to spell-check using that dictionary.\nhunspell requires two dictionary files for a language: the .dic and the .aff file. In this example we take the German dictionary files de_DE_frami.aff and de_DE_frami.dic and save them in the inst folder where our WORDLIST_EXAMPLE.txt file is as well. I am not sure why, but hunspell will look for the file de_CH_FRAMI.dic when we specify lang = \"inst/de_CH_frami\" so make sure to rename the .dic and .aff files as de_DE_FRAMI.aff and de_DE_FRAMI.dic\n\nlist.files(\"../../inst\")\n\n[1] \"de_CH_frami.aff\"      \"de_CH_frami.dic\"      \"de_DE_frami.aff\"     \n[4] \"de_DE_frami.dic\"      \"WORDLIST_EXAMPLE.txt\"\n\n\n\nspelling::spell_check_files(\"Zitat.txt\", lang = \"../../inst/de_CH_frami\")\n\n  WORD              FOUND IN\nverowokjnsthet.   Zitat.txt:1\n\n\nOn the first try I got an encoding error, but after restarting RStudio this worked well.\n…"
