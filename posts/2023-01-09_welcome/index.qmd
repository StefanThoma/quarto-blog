Hi there, and welcome to this blog.
I am a statistical programmer. 
I write this blog to have a reference of what I have done previously, and how I did it. 
Making this public encourages me to write more explicitly, which in turn will make it easier for me to understand the next time I try to do something similar. 





<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "StefanThoma/quarto-blog",
  name = long_slug
)
```
